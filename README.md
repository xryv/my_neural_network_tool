## Project Structure

The project is organized into several scripts and files, each serving a specific purpose in the pipeline:

- `scripts/`
    - `training.py`: Contains the initial model training routines.
    - `model.py`: Defines the model architecture.
    - `data_loading.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
    - `automated_tuning.py`: Implements automated hyperparameter tuning.
    - `retrain.py`: Manages retraining and fine-tuning the model.
    - `test.py`: Evaluates the model's performance.
    - `adjust_model.py`: Adjusts model architecture or training configurations.
    - `load_additional_data.py`: Loads and preprocesses additional data.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker container for this project.
- `main.py`: The entry point to the project, orchestrating the various phases.
- `deploy.py`: Handles the deployment of the trained model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.
- `README.md`: (This file) Provides an overview and usage instructions for the project.
